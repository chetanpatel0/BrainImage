# üñºÔ∏è BrainImage: The Secure Image Sharing tool

BrainImage is a powerful, 100% offline web application designed for the ultra-secure sharing of confidential images. It allows you to package multiple images into a single, self-contained HTML file with robust access controls, ensuring your content is only seen by those you choose, under the rules you set.

The core principle of BrainImage is **absolute privacy and security**, achieved without ever needing an internet connection or sending your data to a server.

## üîí The "Secure Aperture" (Keyhole) Mode

This is the flagship feature that makes BrainImage truly secure. For maximum confidentiality, you can enable the **"Secure Aperture"** mode.

- **How it Works:** The image is completely blacked out. The user can only view it through a small, moving "spotlight" that follows their cursor or finger.
- **Why it's Secure:** This makes taking a usable screenshot **physically impossible**. A screenshot will only capture a small, meaningless fragment of the image, while the user's brain seamlessly stitches the revealed parts together to perceive the full picture.
- **Per-Image Control:** You can enable Aperture Mode for all images in a package or toggle it for individual photos, giving you granular control over your security.
